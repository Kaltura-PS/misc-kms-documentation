In this page, we will install the MediaSpace CLI and generate basic module code.

## Prerequisites

-   A local KMS (Kaltura MediaSpace) installation.
-   A local copy of the `mediaspace-react-components` repository.
-   Access to Kaltura's `npm` registry (please contact your Kaltura representative).

## Creating a new module from template

### Install the KMS CLI

KMS CLI is a command line tool that allows you to run certain tasks from the command line instead of doing them manually or via KMS' UI.

1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to `mediaspace` directory.
3. Install Composer dependencies by running `composer install`.
4. Run `chmod +x mediaspace` to make the binary file executable.

### Create the module

From the `mediaspace` directory, run `mediaspace make:module -c <module-name>`, where `<module-name>` is the name of your module.

This will create a new directory in `mediaspace/modulesCustom/core` which includes the minimum code for a working module.

<Aside type="note" title="Info">
MediaSpace supports 3 kinds of modules:

1. Core modules, which reside in the `modules` directory. These modules are available for all customers.
2. Custom core modules, which reside in the `modulesCustom/core` directory, and are part of MediaSpace's codebase. On a SaaS installation,
   these modules are not available to all customers, and can be turned on only via a KMS SaaS administrator.
3. Custom PS (Professional Services) / Integration Partner modules, which reside in the `modulesCustom/contrib` directory.
   Each module is managed in its own git repository. On a SaaS installation, such modules are deployed separately and are turned on via a
   KMS SaaS administrator.

Currently, the CLI only supports creating core & custom core modules. But since a module's basic structure is the same for all module types,
you can simply move the directory from the `modulesCustom/core` to `modulesCustom/contrib`.

## Create a design-system (DS) compatible component

In this section, we will install the React-Components CLI tool that will allow us to create a new React component that can be used in
MediaSpace.

### Install MediaSpace React-Components CLI tool

1. Navigate to `mediaspace-react-component` directory.
2. If you're using [`nvm`, or Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (recommended), run `nvm use` to install the supported Node
   & `npm` versions.
3. Run `npm install -g` to install the CLI tool globally, which will be accessible via the `mrc` (short for MediaSpace React Components)
   command.

### Generating a React application

1. Navigate to your module's \*root directory.
2. Run `mrc ps:project <module-name>`. This command will create a directory called `app` and will initialize a new project there.

:::note

\* Non-core modules, given that they're not part of the `mediaspace` codebase, and given that there's a need to be able to have code /
documentation that is not part of the module's deployment, must have the following structure:

```
module-mymodule      # this is the name of the repo that hosts the `mymodule` module
    mymodule/
        assets/
        controllers/
        models/
        views/
        admin.ini
        default.ini
        module.info
    README.md
    # other directories, such as `app`
```
